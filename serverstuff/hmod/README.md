Serverstuff is a weird service whose sole purpose is to allow a client to :

- Execute commands on the snes classic, started in a shell so you can use | or >
- Read or write the memory of a processus.
- Download and upload files
- Stream a steamable file (like /dev/input*)
- 
It's needed to use your SNES classic with software like QUsb2sne
